To decide on an idea on 07/03/2023

# Mike - Suceptability to land invasion

Using remote sensing to classify land that has been invaded. Possible use of deep learning to identify common characeristics of these areas, allowing potential identification of future vulnerable sites. 



# James - CO2 reduction from changes in transport modes

To reduce green house gas emissions from transportation. to monitor CO2 after changes changes in modes of transport. 

- Estimate average vehicle traffic
- Classify vehicle types
  - Using car data as an inpit and remote sensing as a monitor of how well the policy is doing. 
- Monitor CO2 emissions



# Zach - Beijing Blue

Using remote sensing to identify areas/ communities contradicting the goal of reducing pollution. 

# Phil - Pollution and forest type

Parks mitigating particulate matter. identified three types of forests:

- PM blockers
- PM mitigation (absorbs)
- Urban forest (wind corridor)



MODIS to identify the concentration of PM within cities, to capture how the pollutants move and concnetrate within the city in relation to the forest types.
