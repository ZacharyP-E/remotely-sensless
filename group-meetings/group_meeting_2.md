# Setting a Research Direction

Example question: 

- To what extent does the implementation of forests in urban areas reduce airborne pollution concnetration? 



## Existing Policies:

Policy about urban forest, severe air pollution coming from west. trying to mitigate pollution by building urban forests.

- Blockage forest (next to factory to not allow pollutants through the forest, densly planet).
- Wind corridor (sparsely planets, where people spend most of their time e.g. schools, pollutants from cars can pass through quickly to make a wind corridor. allowing them to be dispursed).
- Mitigation forest (normally planeted in some parks, main purpose to absorb air pollutants, reduce risidual PM).



## Problem Definition

**Using remote sensing to optimise placement of forests to mitigate poor air pollution. ****

- Placing some to absorb pollution. 
- Some forests to blow wind away, needs strong prevaling wind. 





Considering:

- Wind direction
- Pollution concentration





Starting with Seoul as a case study, to provide a basis/ example on how to imporve your urban air quality. 

**Using lessons Learnt in Seoul to inform urban planning policy in Leicester, with regards to pollution mitigation measures. **

## Possible other city: 

- **Leicester, UK**
  - Blames its poor air pollution to neighbouring cities of Manchester, Liverpool, and Leeds. [[Link]](https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/council-claims-dirty-neighbouring-cities-1534393)
  - Would the implementation of PM mitigation urban forests benefit their poor air quality?
