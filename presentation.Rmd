# Problem Definition

.pull-left[- UN SDG 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by *paying special attention to air quality* and municipal and other waste management

- In the UK, many cities have high levels of PM2.5 and NO2 concentration.

- In the South East, this is partly due to emissions from London and Europe `r Citep(myBib, "centreforcitiesHoldingOurBreath2020")`]

# Problem Definition


* The health consequences of these high emissions are significant for the UK: 
  - Estimated 20 000 hospital emissions per year
  - Up to "2.5 million new cases of coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and other health conditions by 2035 if pollution levels remain the same"** (CITE)**
* Slough is particularly badly affected: Over 6% of deaths in the city are attributable to PM2.5 pollution `r Citep(myBib, "centreforcitiesHoldingOurBreath2020")`:

# Approach
## Methods - Site Suitablity Analysis
Using existing data to identify the optimal locations for future forests within and around the city of Leicester, UK.

graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

a [label = 'Suitable Site', shape = square, fillcolor = Black]
c [label = 'Prevlaining Wind Direction']
b [label = 'Pollution Concentration']

# Return on Investment
- Reduction in premature mortality, reduced burden on healthcare (NHS) leading to savings in related departments (cardiovascular?).
- Increase in housing prices near to forests `r Citep(myBib, "daams2019")`.
- Licencing code to other cities, allowing them to fix their issues with neighbouring pollution.
