# Problem Definition

.pull-left[- UN SDG 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by *paying special attention to air quality* and municipal and other waste management

- In the UK, many cities have high levels of PM2.5 and NO2 concentration.

- In the South East, this is partly due to emissions from London and Europe `r Citep(myBib, "centreforcitiesHoldingOurBreath2020")`]

# Problem Definition


* Estimated cost to society of air pollution in Slough: £40m / year `r Citep(myBib, "nancarrow2019")`
* Slough is particularly badly affected: Over 6% of deaths in the city are attributable to PM2.5 pollution `r Citep(myBib, "centreforcitiesHoldingOurBreath2020")`:

# Problem Definition - Slough's Current Approach on PM2.5



* **Air Quality Action Policy** was established to be in line with UK Government's `Environment Act 1995` ([Slough Borough Council](https://democracy.slough.gov.uk/documents/s52745/Appendix%202%20-%20LES%20Technical%20Report%20Final%20Draft.pdf), 2018).



  - City's on-going measures to control and reduce PM ([Slough Borough Council](https://www.slough.gov.uk/downloads/file/160/asr-2020), 2020):
  
    - `Smoke Control Orders`
    - Acceleration of the uptake of `Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV)`
    - Promotion of `best practice dust controls` on construction sites
    - Reducing congestion by `reducing dependency on cars`

# Problem Definition - Slough's Urban Forest Activities


* The city currently runs two urban forest activities: 
  - `Urban Tree Challenge`: focus on NO2 and specifies 4 designated sites
  - `Digital Urban Forest`: monitoring air quality using IoT devices

#Approach -  3 Types of PM Urban Forests

- `PM Blockage Urban Forests`: 1,800 trees/ha
- `PM Mitigation Urban Forests`: 800 - 1,000 trees/ha
- `Wind Corridor Urban Forests`: Less than 500 trees/ha

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="40%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="PM Urban Forest Types (Source: Edited from Korea Forest Service, n.d)"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/type.png')
```
---
#Approach - Why PM Urban Forests?

- Urban forest types tailored for PM reduction suit better 
- Increase City's Green Cover which is below national standard 20% ([Slough Borough Council](https://www.slough.gov.uk/urbantree), n.d)
- Urban Forests could achieve rather prominent decrease in PM
- Low cost

# Approach
## Methods - Site Suitablity Analysis
Using existing data to identify the optimal locations for future forests within and around the city of Slough, UK. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', out.height= '60%'}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

a [label = 'Suitable Site', shape = square, fillcolor = Black]
c [label = 'Prevlaining Wind Direction']
b [label = 'Pollution Concentration']
d [label = 'Existing infrastructure']


{b c d} -> a
}")

#Project Plan

# Project Plan

By using open source, freely available data, we aim to spend the majority of the budget on tree planting in collaboration with our partner charity, [Trees for Cities](https://www.treesforcities.org/). At **£6** per tree, this will enable Slough to plant 60 000 trees, dramatically enhancing its existing green infrastructure and potentially reducing the harmful effects of PM2.5 concentration. We have also included a training output in our workplan, meaning that Slough will be equipped to continue using the model we build together past the lifecycle of this project. 



| **Phase**                   | **Output**                                           | **Stakeholders**                             | **Budget** |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Months 1-3: Work Package 1  | Data collection, initial model created, training     | Local Authority - consultation and training  | £70,000  |
| Months 3-6: Work Package 2  | Identify suitable sites                              | Local Authority and residents                | £70,000  |
| Months 6-12: Work Package 3 | Tree planting in collaboration with Trees For Cities | Local Authority, residents, Trees For Cities | £360,000 |

# Project Plan - Return on Investment
- Reduction in premature mortality, reduced burden on healthcare (NHS) leading to savings in related departments (Estimated £40m / year)`r Citep(myBib, "nancarrow2019")`.
- Increase in housing prices near to forests `r Citep(myBib, "daams2019")`.
- Licencing code to other cities, allowing them to fix their issues with neighbouring pollution.
