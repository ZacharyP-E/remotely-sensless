# Problem Definition

- Leicester generates relatively low levels of PM2, but has high rates of avoidable deaths due to poor air quality compared to other UK cities `r Citep(myBib, "centreforcitiesHoldingOurBreath2020")`

- The Leicester council has attributed this to polluted air being blown in from neighbouring cities `r Citep(myBib, "birdLeicesterNamedOne2018")`

# Approach
## Methods - Site Suitablity Analysis
Using existing data to identify the optimal locations for future forests within and around the city of Leicester, UK.

graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

a [label = 'Suitable Site', shape = square, fillcolor = Black]
c [label = 'Prevlaining Wind Direction']

# Return on Investment
- Reduction in premature mortality, reduced burden on healthcare (NHS) leading to savings in related departments (cardiovascular?).
- Increase in housing prices near to forests `r Citep(myBib, "daams2019")`.
- Licencing code to other cities, allowing them to fix their issues with neighbouring pollution.
