# Problem Definition

.pull-left[- UN SDG 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by *paying special attention to air quality* and municipal and other waste management

- In the UK, many cities have high levels of PM2.5 and NO2 concentration.

- In the South East, this is partly due to emissions from London and Europe `r Citep(myBib, "centreforcitiesHoldingOurBreath2020")`]

# Problem Definition


* The health consequences of these high emissions are significant for the UK: 
  - Estimated 20 000 hospital admissions per year
  - Up to "2.5 million new cases of coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and other health conditions by 2035 if pollution levels remain the same"** (CITE)**
* Slough is particularly badly affected: Over 6% of deaths in the city are attributable to PM2.5 pollution `r Citep(myBib, "centreforcitiesHoldingOurBreath2020")`:

# Slough's Current Approach on PM2.5

--

* **Air Quality Action Policy** was established to be in line with UK Government's `Environment Act 1995` ([Slough Borough Council](https://democracy.slough.gov.uk/documents/s52745/Appendix%202%20-%20LES%20Technical%20Report%20Final%20Draft.pdf), 2018).

--

  - City's on-going measures to control and reduce PM ([Slough Borough Council](https://www.slough.gov.uk/downloads/file/160/asr-2020), 2020):
  
    - `Smoke Control Orders`
    - Acceleration of the uptake of `Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV)`
    - Promotion of `best practice dust controls` on construction sites
    - Reducing congestion by `reducing dependency on cars`
    - `Urban Forests`

---
--

### Most of measures call for changes in transport and construction.

--

### However, this would take a lot of time to accomplish transitions in these sectors

--

### There is a need for alternatives which bring prominent changes in PM levels with low budget

--

### And these are **Urban Forests!**


---
# Slough's Urban Forest Activities

--
* The city currently runs two urban forest activities: 
  - `Urban Tree Challenge`: focus on NO2 and specifies 4 designated sites
  - `Digital Urban Forest`: monitoring air quality using IoT devices
  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "50%", fig.show='hold', fig.align= 'center', fig.cap= "Slough's Urban Forest Programmes (Source: [Slough Borough Council](https://www.slough.gov.uk/environment/trees-hedges-1/8), n.d.)"}

# 3 Types of PM Urban Forests

- `PM Blockage Urban Forests`: 1,800 trees/ha
- `PM Mitigation Urban Forests`: 800 - 1,000 trees/ha
- `Wind Corridor Urban Forests`: Less than 500 trees/ha

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="40%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="PM Urban Forest Types (Source: Edited from Korea Forest Service, n.d)"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/type.png')
```
---
# Why PM Urban Forests?

- Urban forest types tailored for PM reduction suit better 
- Increase City's Green Cover which is below national standard 20% ([Slough Borough Council](https://www.slough.gov.uk/urbantree), n.d)
- Urban Forests could achieve rather prominent decrease in PM
- Low cost

## Prevalining wind direction
MET Office Wind Map [[Data]](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/maps-and-charts/wind-map#?bbox=[[43.16512263158296,-35.63964843750001],[63.509375401175134,27.641601562500004]]&model=ukmo-ukv&layer=wind-speed-and-direction)

# Integration to business as usual
## Existing GIS teams 

[Existing tree strategy](https://www.leicester.gov.uk/content/tree-strategy-21-22/) (old link to leicester, needs changing.)

- The project will develop a workflow and methodology for future applications, allowing existing GIS analysts to re-run analysis in the future should it be needed.

# Return on Investment
- Reduction in premature mortality, reduced burden on healthcare (NHS) leading to savings in related departments (cardiovascular?).
- Increase in housing prices near to forests `r Citep(myBib, "daams2019")`.
- Licencing code to other cities, allowing them to fix their issues with neighbouring pollution.

# Project Plan

By using open source, freely available data, we aim to spend the majority of the budget on tree planting in collaboration with our partner charity, [Trees for Cities](https://www.treesforcities.org/). At GBP6 per tree, this will enable Slough to plant 60 000 trees, dramatically enhancing its existing green infrastructure and potentially reducing the harmful effects of PM2.5 concentration. We have also included a training output in our workplan, meaning that Slough will be equipped to continue using the model we build together past the lifecycle of this project.
