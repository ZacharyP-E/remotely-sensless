  abstract = {One of the critical issues in urban planning is the determination of appropriate locations for urban growth in marginal areas adjacent to large-scale development. This study aims to use a Geographic Information System (GIS) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to choose the best locations of urban growth in Seremban, Malaysia. Various social, economic, environmental, utilities, and physical factors were used to generate a final land suitability map (LSI) including elevation, slope, soil texture, population density, land cover, distance to roads, highways, railways, powerlines, streams, industrial, residential, commercial, and educational areas. The findings of the study reveal that highly suitable areas for urban growth in Seremban reach up to 48\% of its total area, while unsuitable and less suitable areas make up 35\%. These findings confirm that unsuitable and less suitable areas such as forests and agricultural lands cover approximately half of Seremban, which means that these techniques can help save the ecosystem in marginal areas as well as create future sustainable development.},

  abstract = {This paper offers new insight into the monetary value of green space at the intra-urban level. To this end, an established monetary valuation method, hedonic price analysis, is integrated with a relatively novel non-monetary valuation method. In specific, online value mapping-based survey data (N\,=\,723) are used to inform hedonic models of the preferences that potential home buyers may have for nearby attractive green spaces. The estimation uses data on 35,298 home transactions in the Amsterdam agglomeration's urban core. Homes nearby attractive green space are found to sell at a price premium, which decays with distance and becomes negligible after one kilometer. The estimated price-effect varies from 7.1\%\textendash 9.3\% for houses within 0.25\,km from the nearest attractive green space to 1.7\%\textendash 2.3\% for houses located at 0.75\textendash 1.0\,km away, depending on the scale at which omitted spatial variables are controlled for. Adding to the discussion of spatial controls in this type of analysis, the controls are evaluated at multiple scales and a metric that simplifies the interpretation of the scale of spatial controls \textendash{} the mean equalized diameter \textendash{} is introduced. This study's findings may inform policymakers who seek to maximize the well-being of urban citizens through public investments in attractive amenities.},
